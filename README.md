# Data Structures for Java 

This repository contains a public record of all the content I created for my data structures course at Smith College (CSC212) in S2020.

## Can I study this without taking the course?

Maybe? You'll be missing the first ~5-6 weeks of the course, which are kind of important. If you're comfortable with Java for other reasons you may enjoy these videos.

## Why did you create so many videos?

Research says that students do best with videos of about 6 minutes in length. I didn't always keep the videos that small, but I tried.

## What if I have questions/critiques about these videos?

File an issue!

## What's the status of the close-captioning?

YouTube automatic for now. I'd like to import them to this repo at some point and edit them so there's text alongside the videos.
