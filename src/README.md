# Data Structures in Java for Smith College (Videos)

This website currently begins a few weeks into the course I would usually teach, after finishing the pure-Java topics.

## Lists: Linked & Array

We typically spend a significant amount of time on lists as the data structure family where we practice implementing every method of a data structure.

- [Fixed Size Lists and ArrayLists](FSL.md)
- [Singly Linked-Lists](SLL.md)
- [Doubly Linked-Lists](DLL.md)
- [Chunky ArrayLists](ChunkyArrayList.md)
- [Lists Conclusions](Lists.md)

## Sorting

A sorted list can be considered a set data structure, so covering sorting also makes a fair bit of sense -- also it provides motivation for trees and practice with recursion.

- [Sorting (Part 1): Binary Search, IsSorted, BubbleSort](Sorting1.md)
- [Sorting (Part 2): Insertion, Selection and Merge Sort](Sorting2.md)
- [QuickSort](QuickSort.md)

## Trees

Trees are broadly useful and heaps are critical to a number of applications. They also continue the journey of learning to reason about relationships between nodes and data on the way to graphs.

- [Intro to Trees](Trees.md)
- [Heaps & HeapSort](Heaps.md)

## HashTables

HashTables can provide nearly O(1) lookup, insert, and remove by spending some additional space on empty buckets.

- [Hashing, HashTables, HashSets, and HashMaps](HashTables.md)

## Algorithms Preview

Data structures naturally feeds into algorithms topics, so we cover some of these at the end of this course as a "What's-next?" setup.

- [Intro to Graphs & Graph Algorithms](Graphs.md)
